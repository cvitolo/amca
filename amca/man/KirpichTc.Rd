\arguments{
\item{length}{this is the length of the main river channel (in metres, usually obtained by GIS layers)}

\item{slope}{this is the average slope of the main river channel (dimensionless, usually obtained by GIS layers)}
}
\value{
time of concentration (in days)
}
\description{
This function calculates the catchment's time of concentration (Tc) using Kirpich's formula.
